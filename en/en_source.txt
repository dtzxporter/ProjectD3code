VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_SNIPERFI_INTRO_01|^2 Price: ^7 No one can find Huck, he disappeared.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_SNIPERFI_INTRO_02|^2 Price: ^7 We will continue to find the reason.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_SNIPERFI_INTRO_03|^2 Price: ^7 At the same time, the original order remained unchanged.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_SNIPERFI_INTRO_04|^2 Price: ^7 The factory was heavily guarded and the mercenaries were well-equipped.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_SNIPERFI_INTRO_05|^2 Price: ^7 The drone is about to arrive and you will get some air support.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_SNIPERFI_INTRO_06|^2 Price: ^7 Sneak into the factory and find out exactly what the 115 elements are.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_SNIPERFI_OUTRO_01|^2 Ghost: ^7 Price, I'm a ghost - I have entered the factory.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_SNIPERFI_OUTRO_02|^2 Ghost: ^7 They are making chemical weapons here.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_SNIPERFI_OUTRO_03|^2 Ghost: ^7 These canisters are being shipped to a warehouse on the other side of the base.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_SNIPERFI_OUTRO_04|^2 ghost: ^7 soap, you take the couple to the warehouse. I am here to continue reconnaissance.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_SNIPERFI_OUTRO_05|^2 Soap: ^7 You heard - let's go.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_STORM_INTRO_01|^2 Price: ^7 Huck there is still no news.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_STORM_INTRO_02|^2 Price: ^7 But we have a chance in front of us - it looks like the mercenaries are regrouping.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_STORM_INTRO_03|^2 Price: ^7 Rushed to the warehouse immediately, opened the shady behind these chemical weapons.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_STORM_OUTRO_01|^2 Price: ^7 I have a piece of news, a bad news.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_STORM_OUTRO_02|^2 Price: ^7 No matter whether it is a mercenary or a worker, no one knows who is hiring them to work in the factory.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_STORM_OUTRO_03|^2 Price: ^7 It is clear that the job of a worker is to make the 115 element that Vasquez smuggled into a deadly poison called Nova 6.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_STORM_OUTRO_04|^2 Price: ^7 At the same time, we are not sure that this person in the video must be Huck.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_STORM_OUTRO_05|^2 Price: ^7 This does not make sense. But I believe my eyes.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_STORM_OUTRO_06|^2 Price: ^7 To be sure, these mercenary weaponry is by no means under us and is not soft on our own people.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_STORM_OUTRO_07|^2 Price: ^7 For Vasquez this loss of value of the mercenary, kill without pardon ...
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_AC130_INTRO_01|^2 Price: ^7 All Listened - The Command believes the weapons of mass destruction here are extremely dangerous.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_AC130_INTRO_02|^2 Price: ^7 They have to put a "bomb of the mother" to clear the market.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_AC130_INTRO_03|^2 Price: ^7 That is to say, we have to get you out quickly.

VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_AC130_INTRO_05|^2 Price: ^7 I dispatched an "aerial gunboat" to pick it up. action!
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_AC130_OUTRO_01|^2 Price: ^7 The information you gathered shows that almost all of Novo 6's canisters are on the books ...
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_AC130_OUTRO_02|^2 Price: ^7 ... except one of them.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_AC130_OUTRO_03|^2 Price: ^7 Information shows that this Novo 6 gas tank has been shipped to the country of Pantal.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_AC130_OUTRO_04|^2 Price: ^7 That's right ... Bacard's rival.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_AC130_OUTRO_05|^2 Price: ^7 These two countries are already on the brink of war.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_AC130_OUTRO_06|^2 Price: ^7 Once the Nova 6 is deployed in Pantal, conflict between the two countries will surely escalate, and the entire region will confuse life.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_AC130_OUTRO_07|^2 Price: ^7 This is precisely the result of a well-planned, well-planned period by someone.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_AC130_OUTRO_08|^2 Price: ^7 Perhaps this man is Bacardi's sworn enemy; there is also the possibility that those who attacked us in the Warito are behindhand.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_AC130_OUTRO_09|^2 Price: ^7 But we have not had time to trace the masters behind the scenes.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_AC130_OUTRO_10|^2 Price: ^7 The current priority is to locate the missing Nova 6 and dismantle the bomb before it is detonated.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_BIGBROTHER_INTRO_01|^2 Price: ^7 Huck has taken the bomb into the city and his men are preparing for the detonation.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_BIGBROTHER_INTRO_02|^2 Price: ^7 Once a bomb is detonated, civilian casualties will be immeasurable.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_BIGBROTHER_INTRO_03|^2 Price: ^7 You must arrive on the scene before Huck's detonator Nova 6.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_BIGBROTHER_INTRO_04|^2 Price: ^7 Set out immediately and win Huck!
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_BIGBROTHER_OUTRO_01|^2 Price: ^7 Nice, young man.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_BIGBROTHER_OUTRO_02|^2 Price: ^7 But now Huck is going up to your position to set foot in for counterattack.

VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_BIGBROTHER_OUTRO_04|^2 Price: ^7 You have to keep soap and Nova 6 safe at all costs!

VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_LASTSTAND_INTRO_03|^1 Huck: ^7 What are their odds? how much do you have?
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_LASTSTAND_INTRO_04|^1 Huck: ^7 I know your tactics. Textbook is what I wrote.

VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_LASTSTAND_INTRO_06|^2 Price: ^7 Huck! Hand immediately! Or do not blame me you are welcome!
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_LASTSTAND_INTRO_07|^2 Price: ^7 The outcome of the battle is hard to predict. We must be prepared.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_LASTSTAND_INTRO_08|^2 Price: ^7 Deploy defense, guard Nova 6.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_LASTSTAND_INTRO_09|^2 Price: ^7 Also, if you have the ability - get rid of that scum.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_LASTSTAND_OUTRO_01|^2 Price: ^7 The problem is that if the Shadow Legion forces so pervasive
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_LASTSTAND_OUTRO_02|^2 Price: ^7 So no one can predict how the situation will develop.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_LASTSTAND_OUTRO_03|^2 Price: ^7 Shadow Corps now temporarily suspended birds and animals.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_LASTSTAND_OUTRO_04|^2 Price: ^7 Probed to have escaped to their underground lair.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_LASTSTAND_OUTRO_05|^2 Price: ^7 However, one day, we'll find their lair.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_LASTSTAND_OUTRO_06|^2 Price: ^7 By that time, none of them wants to escape.
VIDSUBTITLES_SPOV_LASTSTAND_OUTRO_07|^2 Price: ^7 By that time, we want to make them bloodthirsty ...

VIDSUBTITLES_CRASH_OUTRO_01|^2 Price: ^7 Vazquez and the Kortz Criminal Group are shipping a chemical known as the 115 Element.
VIDSUBTITLES_CRASH_OUTRO_02|^2 Price: ^7 And even worse, they're going to Barkha. Yes, it is so bad.
VIDSUBTITLES_CRASH_OUTRO_03|^2 Price: ^7 Clerks and diplomats are approaching Bakha. We look for information about the 115 elements in the black market.
VIDSUBTITLES_CRASH_OUTRO_04|^2 Price: ^7 At the same time, I'm going to send you to the origin of the chemical. You did well today - but the task has just begun.
VIDSUBTITLES_ESTATE_INTRO_01|^2 Price: ^7 Vazquez and the criminal syndicates are plotting to ship something abroad.

VIDSUBTITLES_FAVELA_OUTRO_01|^2 Soap: ^7 Price, I'm soap. Vazquez is against Ortiz. Vazquez is even more frightening than we are worried about -
VIDSUBTITLES_FAVELA_OUTRO_02|^2 Soap: ^7 He has been armed with a Cortez criminal group with military-grade weapons. In return, they helped him deliver the goods.
VIDSUBTITLES_FAVELA_OUTRO_03|^2 Ghost: ^7 The bastard knew we were here - Vazquez hid in his own mansion.
VIDSUBTITLES_FAVELA_OUTRO_04|^2 Price: ^7 Vazquez acts as an umbrella for the Cotzi criminal syndicate and it is not good news.
VIDSUBTITLES_FAVELA_OUTRO_05|^2 Ghost: ^7 Ortiz did not say much, but referred to the city of Audran.
VIDSUBTITLES_FAVELA_OUTRO_06|^2 Price: ^7 We have to catch Vazquez before we attack him at the base of Audrain. We plan to go to his manor at six in the morning.

VIDSUBTITLES_EVASION_PRI_00_02|^2 Price: ^7 They also said that the 115-element factory was not in the Bakkhas but in a "demilitarized zone" at the border with neighboring countries.
VIDSUBTITLES_EVASION_PRI_00_03|^2 Price: ^7 This is actually the demilitarized zone at the junction of the two countries
VIDSUBTITLES_EVASION_PRI_00_04|^2 Price: ^7 Colonel Huck, our commander, believes that this task will not yield any results, but the Central Command instructed us to sneak into the demilitarized zone
VIDSUBTITLES_EVASION_PRI_00_10|^2 Price: ^7 Huck ordered us to secretly observe, so we have to keep a low profile
